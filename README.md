# Incredibly Useful Tokens

This repository is meant for some dummy implementations of [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) tokens (currently just one).

It is basically used for quick testing of other applications (for example, you can deploy these tokens to your local environment and see how your own Smart Contracts interact with them).

Furthermore, it contains some useful hardhat tasks for performing operations on ERC-20 tokens.
